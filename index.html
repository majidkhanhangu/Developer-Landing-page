              <p>
                Web development, also known as website development, refers to
                the tasks associated with creating, building, and maintaining
                websites and web applications that run online on a browser. It
                may, however, also include web design, web programming, and
                database management.

              <p>
                Mobile application development is the process of making software
                for smartphones, tablets and digital assistants, most commonly
                for the Android and iOS operating systems. The software can be
                preinstalled on the device, downloaded from a mobile app store
                or accessed through a mobile web browser.

              <p>
                User experience (UX) design is the process design teams use to
                create products that provide meaningful and relevant experiences
                to users. UX design involves the design of the entire process of
                acquiring and integrating the product, including aspects of
                branding, design, usability and function.

          Explain why someone should contact your business. Describe how your

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          An 'About Me' page should convey who you are, what your values and
          principles are, how you got to where you are, and why your product or
          service is important to you. If writing an 'About Me' page seems
          daunting, you can use an about us template to help you out.
